Component Library designed for Odin Control Interfaces, build with [Vite](https://vite.dev/)

## Install

### From Github Repository

```bash
cd <project_dir>
npm install --save git@github.com:stfc-aeg/odin-react.git
```

## Usage

Basic React knowledge will be required to use this component library. [Tutorials](https://react.dev/learn) are available that cover the basics of React.

It's recommended that the React App is created using the [Cookiecutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io/) [Template](https://github.com/stfc-aeg/odin-react-template).

This git repository includes an [Example App](https://github.com/stfc-aeg/odin-react/tree/master/src), along with an example [Odin Control Adapter](https://github.com/stfc-aeg/odin-react/tree/master/control), that can be used as reference for how the components may look and interact with Odin Control.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/stfc-aeg/odin-react/wiki) for detailed information about each component

## Requirements

All required dependencies are automatically installed into your npm project when first running `npm install` on a newly copied templated application.

Styling is provided by [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction). Many components can be imported and used from this library.
